% Monkey and Banana problem
% • There is a monkey, a single bunch of bananas (or one banana, if you prefer), and a box
% • The monkey, box, and bananas are each at different locations to start
% • The bananas are hanging too high for the monkey to reach, but if the monkey climbs on top of the box, the monkey can grab the bananas
% • The monkey is analogous to a robot with the following basic functionality:
%        ◦ The monkey can go to a specific location
%        ◦ The monkey can push the box to a specific location
%        ◦ The monkey can climb onto and climb off the box
%        ◦ If the conditions are right, the monkey can grab the bananas
% • The monkey needs to plan a sequence of actions that will result in achieving the goal: the monkey having the bananas
