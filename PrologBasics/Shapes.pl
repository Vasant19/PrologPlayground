/* 
 Purpose:
  This program demonstrates the use of Prolog to represent and manipulate 
  complex structures such as points, line segments, triangles, and rectangles 
  in a 2D space. The program explores Prolog's capabilities to:
  - Define and manipulate structures using predicates and functors.
  - Match variables and structures with logical constraints.
  - Use built-in predicates like dif/2 to enforce conditions.
  - Write and test queries for predicates to validate their correctness.

  Features:
  1. Define a set of points (point/2 predicate) in a 2D integer grid that meet specified criteria.
  2. Implement a seg/2 predicate to identify valid line segments between points.
  3. Create a triangle/3 predicate to determine if three points form a valid triangle.
  4. Develop a rectangle/2 predicate to identify valid rectangles formed by vertical segments.
  5. Perform queries to validate each predicate and demonstrate logical reasoning.
